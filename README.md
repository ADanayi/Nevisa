# Nevisa
An opensource ez2use zip locker for diaries

## What is Nevisa?
Nevisa is a Persian word that means the tool aimed for writing. I developed this application right after one read my diaries on my laptop without my permission!
You can register your diaries folder to Nevisa and then it zip-locks your diries into one file that can only be extracted again with its password.
I tried my best to make its GUI fast2work, but one of my friends don't like it and I simply don't care, cause they pay too much attention to details :P.

## Platform
Nevisa is developed for Linux Ubuntu.

## Dependencies
`sudo apt-get install zip unzip`

## How to use
Compile the project and run it. You will need Qt5. You can always set a new password for Nevisa by entering:
`Master Password: NewPassword`
`Second Password: np`

When you setup the password run the application again and then enter your passwords. Then choose your `Root Folder` and the rest is simple.

Just have a look at the tray ICON.

Bests,
